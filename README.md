## Project Description

People living in or planning to move into New York City have different standards when considering a place to stay. In many cases, people prefer to live further from their work/school due to their following concerns:

<ul>
<li>Safety</li>
<li>Availability of social services</li>
<li>Financial issues</li>
</ul>

Our group used the crime data, service call data, and housing data collected from the city government of New York and Airbnb to analyze and rank the most livable areas in 5 boroughs — Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island — of New York City
